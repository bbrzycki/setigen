|setigen|_ is a Python library for generating and injecting artificial
narrow-band signals into radio requency data. |setigen|_ interfaces
primarily with two types of data: spectrograms or dynamic spectra, saved in two-dimensional NumPy arrays or filterbank files (:code:`.fil` extension), and raw voltages (GUPPI RAW files). Both data formats are instrumental to Breakthrough Listen's data collection and analysis pipelines.

|setigen|_ allows the user to generate synthetic signals quickly in the
time-frequency domain in the form of data Frames. Furthermore, the user may inject these synthetic signals
into real observational data loaded from filterbank files. |setigen|_ plays well with the |blimpy|_ package.

The :code:`setigen.voltage` module enables the synthesis of GUPPI RAW files via synthetic real voltage "observations" and a software signal processing pipeline that implements a polyphase filterbank, mirroring actual BL hardware. The voltage module supports single and multi-antenna RAW files, and can be GPU accelerated via CuPy.
